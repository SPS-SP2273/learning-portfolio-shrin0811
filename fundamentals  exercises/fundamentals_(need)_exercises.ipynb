Python is organized in **functions.** They can be in-built or user-defined.\n","2. The Python parser interprets the code line-by-line - i.e. it executes the code as it goes along. It stops at a faulty execution by throwing an error and does not proceed any further. \n","3. Python is case-sensitive. \n","4. Code readibility for developers in Python can be enhanced by using comment-lines that usually begin with a `#`. \n","5. Python is case-sensitive. \n","6. `=` - this is the assignment operator, which is **not** the same as `==` - which is a relational operator, checking equality. \n","7. Different blocks of code in Python are separated by _indents._\n","8. Anything within `''` or `\"\"` is a string value (i.e. collection of English characters and letters). Anything else in English is usually considered a variable - a named memory location where data is stored. \n","9. Brackets are used for function calls and/or to store collections of data. \n","10. Additional utilities and operations can be incorporated into Python by `importing` modules/packages. \n","11. `.` - used to access attributes belonging to a particular package/module.
