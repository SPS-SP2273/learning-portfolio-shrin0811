Errors in code are called `exceptions` - and correcting them is called `exception-handling.` As the Python interpreter 'reads' the code line-by-line. Therefore if the exception is not dealt with or 'handled', the code will halt there, and 'throw' an error. Unless the exception is handled, the code will not execute any further. \n","2. `try-except` structures are used to 'catch' the exceptions that are thrown, and handle them. \n","    1.
