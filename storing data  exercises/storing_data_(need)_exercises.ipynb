Similarities between lists and arrays:\n","    1. Both can store multiple elements of various data types in a single container.\n","    2. They support indexing and slicing operations to access and manipulate individual elements.\n","\n","2. Differences between lists and arrays:\n","    1. Lists can contain elements of different data types, while arrays typically store elements of the same data type.\n","    2. Arrays are generally more memory-efficient and faster for numerical computations due to their homogeneous nature, whereas lists provide more flexibility and functionality for general-purpose data storage and manipulation.\n","\n","3. Dictionary in Python:\n","A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a corresponding value. It is used to store and retrieve data efficiently based on keys rather than numerical indices."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"56a15588","metadata":{},"source":["A way to check the number of elements in an array that meets a specific criteria - using list comprehension. \n","An example is given below: "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"22ba7a05","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Number of elements greater than 5: 5\n"]}],"source":["# Example array\n","my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n","\n","# Criteria: Elements greater than 5\n","count = sum(1 for x in my_array if x > 5)\n","\n","print(\"Number of elements greater than 5:\", count)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"d65423fa","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["a1\n","c3\n","e5\n","g7\n","i9\n"]}],"source":["#exercise2\n","py_list = [\"a1\", \"b2\", \"c3\", \"d4\", \"e5\", \"f6\", \"g7\", \"h8\", \"i9\", \"j10\"]\n","for i in range(len(py_list)):\n","    if(i%2==0):\n","        print(py_list[i])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"a411798a","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Boron\n","['Boron']\n"]}],"source":["#exercise3\n","elements = ['Hydrogen',\n","            'Helium', 'Lithium',\n","            'Beryllium', 'Boron', 'Carbon',\n","            'Nitrogen', 'Oxygen',\n","            'Fluorine',\n","            'Neon']\n","print(elements[4])\n","print(elements[4:3:-1])\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"3d72d5a5","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["no. of 1s in the array= 9\n"]}],"source":["#exercise4\n","numbers=[45, 60, 1, 30, 96, 1, 96, 57, 16, 1,\n","        99, 62, 86, 43, 42, 60, 59, 1, 1, 35,\n","        83, 47, 34, 28, 68, 23, 22, 92, 1, 79,\n","        1, 29, 94, 72, 46, 47, 1, 74, 32, 20,\n","        8, 37, 35, 1, 89, 29, 86, 19, 43, 61]                  \n","count=0\n","for i in range(len(numbers)):\n","    if(numbers[i]==1):\n","        count+=1\n","print(\"no. of 1s in the array=\", count)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.1"},"toc":{"base_numbering":1,"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":false,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":false},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
